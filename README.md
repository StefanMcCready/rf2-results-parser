# rf2-results-parser
This is a small package that will allow you to transform a results file generated by the popular racing sim, rFactor2.

As of today the file generated is given to us a very heavy XML document, which is usable, but at the same time probably gives us more information than we need at any given time.

This utility will allow you to pass in a results file and it will parse it into a usable JSON format for you whilst also getting rid of any cruff you may not need right away.

## Usage

**Import (CommonJS)**
```
const parseResults = require('rf2-results-parser');
```

**Import (ES6)**
```
import { parseResults } from 'rf2-results-parser';
```

**Using the funtion**

How you supply it the file is up to you, but chances are you will be using it within an API. Here is an example when using Node's FS module:
```
fs = require('fs');
const parseResults = require('./src/index.js');

fs.readFile('./mocks/race-example.xml', (err, data) => {
  const resultsData = parseResults(data);
  console.log(parsedData);
});

```

For now the function only takes 1 arguement which is the data from the file you supply. An arguement for certain options will be added in due course.
